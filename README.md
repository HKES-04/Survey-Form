### What I learned

Creating a simple survey form website has been an invaluable experience in helping me understand the basics of HTML and CSS. Through this project, I gained hands-on knowledge of building web pages and learned how to structure content using HTML elements. By delving into HTML, I discovered the importance of properly organizing information within a web document. This allowed me to create logical sections within my survey form and ensure a clean and readable layout
